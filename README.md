# Restaurant Location Analysis

This repository contains the code implementation and documentation for the geographical analysis of restaurants developed as part of the internship project at Cognifyz Technologies.

## Overview

The project aims to perform a comprehensive geographical analysis of restaurants using the provided dataset. It includes exploring the distribution of restaurants on maps, grouping them by city or locality, calculating statistics such as average ratings and price ranges, and identifying insights related to restaurant locations.

## Key Features

- Data loading and preprocessing to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
- Visualization of restaurant distribution using folium maps and matplotlib plots.
- K-means clustering analysis to identify spatial clusters of restaurants.
- Calculation and visualization of average ratings, popular cuisines, and common price ranges by region or area.
- Identification of insights and patterns related to restaurant locations.
